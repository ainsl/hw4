My first idea is a simple game that involves clicking the mouse at just the right time. The premise of the game is to capture pictures of the Loch Ness Monster as it moves side to side across the screen. The player's goal is to click the screen when the character is within the frame to take a picture. When the player clicks the mouse, the sound of a camera taking a photo is triggered. If the object was within the frame when they clicked, they score points. If the object was out of the frame when they clicked, they will lose a life. Both score and lives remaining will be tracked in the upper right corner of the screen. I would use the animation technique we learned in class to make the ball move back and forth across the screen to make the character move, and I would use the technique we used to make the alphabet to create the character as a function that can draw multiple shapes or lines together.

Interactivity: Player clicks the mouse when certain circumstances are met
Sound: Clicking the mouse triggers the sound of a camera
Animation: The character is moving left and right across the screen at varying speeds.

Code example: cameragame.js
Sound files:cameraSound.m4a
