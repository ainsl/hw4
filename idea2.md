My second idea is a variation of the “catching things in a basket” kind of game. The player uses the mouse to control a zombie character and the goal is to “infect” people to gain points (the “people” would just be circles). The zombie stays in one place on the x-axis, but can move up and down on the y-axis. There are circles moving at random speeds and in random locations toward the zombie that can either be dodged or intercepted. To score points, the player should try to intercept the circles of a certain color, for instance, white. There would be circles of another color, though, and the player should avoid them. If the player intercepts a circle of the undesired color, for instance, blue, then they would lose a life. The score and the number of lives would be tracked in the upper right corner. I would plan on making this by using mouseX and mouseY like we learned in class, and also using the function technique we did to make the alphabet to make the zombie move with the mouse. I would use the techniques we learned to make the ball move around the screen and to make things appear randomly to make the circles that move across the screen.

INTERACTIVITY: Player uses mouse to move the zombie character
SOUND: When the zombie intercepts a circle, there is a yelling sound
ANIMATION: There are numerous circles moving across the screen toward the zombie

Code example: zombie.js
Sound file: yellSound.wav
